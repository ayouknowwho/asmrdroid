# asmrdroid
An android app for remixing input asmr audio into new randomized audio.

Building for compatibility with Android Oreo (8.0). This is pre-alpha code, and lots of functionality is not yet implemented.

I am currently retaining all copyright but the source code is freely available here and I'm happy for anyone to download/build/use the software for now.
